# Patient Record System
### Programming Fundamentals Assignment #1
This repo contains the WPF C# project for my Programming Fundamentals assignment.

## Logging in
There are 3 user accounts pre registered, 1 admin, 1 doctor, and 1 nurse.
The account credentials are below.
### Doctor
Username: doctor@example.com\
Password: Example123
### Nurse
Username: nurse@example.com\
Password: Example123
### Admin
Username: admin@example.com\
Password: Example123\n

All passwords are case sensitive, and usernames ignore case.
You will be prompted to reset the password on first login.

I haven't pre-populated any more data in the system, meaning you can create user accounts, patients, and appointments as you see fit.
